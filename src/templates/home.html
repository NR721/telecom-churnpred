        <h1>TrustTelecom Churn Prediction</h1>
        <p>Every month, <b>thousands of customers leave</b> service providers;
            acquiring new customers is <b>5 times more expensive</b> than retaining existing ones. 
            As such, our data engineering team created a churn prediction tool (trained on a dataset of 7043 customers based in California),
            empowering the team to identify high-risk customers, provide targeted offers and discounts, and improve overall customer satisfaction.</p>

            <h2>Methodology</h2>
            <p><b>Data Collection & Cleaning</b></p>
            <p>The dataset used in this model consists of 7,043 customer records from California, containing customer demographics, account details, billing history, and service subscriptions.
                Before training the model, the dataset was cleaned and preprocessed, which included handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical fields.
            </p>

            <p><b>Feature Engineering</b></p>
            <p>
                The dataset included both numerical and categorical features. To improve model accuracy, we performed:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>One-hot encoding</b> for categorical variables (e.g., contract type).</li>
                    <li><b>Normalization</b> for numerical features (e.g., total charges per quarter).</li>
                    <li><b>Feature selection</b> to identify key drivers of churn.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p><b>Model Selection & Training</b></p>
            <p>
                Several machine learning models were evaluated, including:
                <ul>
                    <li>Logistic Regression</li>
                    <li>Random Forest</li>
                    <li>XGBoost</li>
                </ul>
                The models were assessed using the <b>AUC (Area Under Curve)</b> metric.
                The <b>Random Forest Classifier</b> achieved the highest AUC score and was selected for deployment.
            </p>

            <p><b>Model Deployment</b></p>
            <p>
                The final model was deployed using a <b>Flask API</b>, allowing users to submit customer data 
                and receive real-time churn predictions. The API was containerized using <b>Docker</b> for scalability.
                This tool enables TrustTelecomâ€™s <b>Customer Care Team</b> to proactively engage with high-risk customers
                and reduce churn.
            </p>
